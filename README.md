# TicTacToe-Java

A simple graphical Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java using Swing. Players take turns placing "X" and "O" on a 3x3 grid, with win/tie detection and a user-friendly interface. This project is perfect for learning GUI development and game logic!

## Features

- **User Interface**: Intuitive GUI built with Java Swing.
- **Gameplay**: Players can alternate turns placing their symbols.
- **Win Detection**: The game checks for wins horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
- **Tie Detection**: The game detects when all tiles are filled without a winner.
- **Visual Feedback**: Winning and tied tiles are highlighted with colors.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HChristopherNaoyuki/tic-tac-toe-java-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd TicTacToe-Java
   ```
3. Compile and run the project:
   ```bash
   javac TicTacToe.java
   java TicTacToe
   ```

## Usage

- Launch the application by running the compiled Java file.
- Click on the empty tiles to place your symbol ("X" or "O").
- The game alternates turns between the two players.
- At the end of the game, the result (winner or tie) will be displayed at the top.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a reset functionality to restart the game.
- Add an AI opponent for single-player mode.
